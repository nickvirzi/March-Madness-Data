Notes

Get teams shooting stats 
Get schedule ex: A/H Marquette W/L [+/- pts] then some basic stats shooting, reb, opp etc

then can search a teams losses and see avg kp stats and compare to tourney matchups to see if they lose or win to certain matchups easier
can see if wins or losses may be flooky ex in a loss shooting 15% from 3 when avg is 35%
